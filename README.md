The main purpose is to allow an easier choice of components when selecting components for a desktop personal computer.
It is a complete client server model with a database for data storage. 
The frontend was made using Vue.js.
The backend was made using Python Flask.
The database is using MongoDB.
The main feature is filtering elements in the build page, allowing only compatible parts to appear in the search. Another features include, authorizing, saving builds, filtering by hardware characteristics, viewing the saved builds, 3 selected videos as tutorials on the main page, an ai chatbot to help answer any questions the user may have.

Seems like i did not push the last few commits before reinstalling windows, so most of the code was lost. The final version can only be found in the demo video, sadly.
